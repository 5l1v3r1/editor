# File Chooser

![Editor](https://github.com/billthefarmer/billthefarmer.github.io/raw/master/images/Editor-chooser.png)

The chooser shows a list of files with icons. Files which appear to be
media files or are too large will be disabled and not
selectable. Touch a folder to change folder, or a file to open a
file. Hidden files beginning with a '.' will not appear.

The parent folder will appear first in the list. Touch that folder to
move up the directory tree. Use a file manager to access files not
accessible with this chooser.
