This is a very simple generic text editor which may be used standalone
or to show or edit any sort of text file from another app. If you
select a text file in a file manager or similar app you will be
offered the option of using this editor along with whatever other apps
you have installed that can show or edit a text file.

There are two toolbar items which may appear:
* **Open** - Open a text file using a chooser
* **Save** - Save the current file if modified

If you touch the back button, and the current file has been modified,
you will be prompted whether you want to exit, else the editor will
just exit.
