This is a very simple text editor which may be used standalone or to
show or edit any sort of text file from another app. If you select a
text file in a file manager or any similar app you will be offered the
option of using this editor along with whatever other apps you have
installed that can show or edit a text file.

There are two toolbar items which may appear:
* **Open** - Open a text file using a chooser
* **Save** - Save the current file if modified

If you touch the back button, and the file has been modified, you will
be prompted whether you want to exit, else the editor will just exit.
