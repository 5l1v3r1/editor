Android simple text editor

![Editor](https://github.com/billthefarmer/billthefarmer.github.io/raw/master/images/Editor.png)

This is a very simple text editor which announces it's presence by
declaring the ability to show or edit any sort of text file. There is
no icon in the launcher, but it will be in the list of installed
apps. If you select a text file in a file manager or any similar app
you will be offered the option of using this editor along with
whatever other apps you have installed that can show or edit a text
file.

There is one button, which will save the file if it has been modified
and exit to the previous app, or else will just exit. If you touch
the back button, and the file has been modified, you will be prompted
whether you want to exit, else the editor will just exit.

You do not need this app if you have
[Diary](https://github.com/billthefarmer/diary) installed. There is a
similar editor built in.
